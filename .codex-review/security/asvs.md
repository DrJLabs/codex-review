## OWASP ASVS Notes
- **V1 Architecture & Design**: Classify data, diagram trust boundaries, and keep security controls centralized. Document mitigations for third-party services and secrets management plans.
- **V2 Authentication**: Enforce MFA-ready flows, lock accounts on brute-force attacks, and validate federated identity tokens server-side.
- **V3 Session Management**: Use secure, httpOnly cookies with SameSite=strict/lax, regenerate session identifiers on privilege changes, and expire idle sessions.
- **V4 Access Control**: Apply server-side authorization checks on every request, prefer role/attribute-based checks, and forbid insecure direct object references.
- **V5 Validation/Sanitization**: Validate input length, type, and range; use allowlists; normalize before validation; encode output contextually to prevent injection.
- **V6 Stored Crypto**: Use vetted algorithms (AES-GCM, Argon2id), rotate keys, and keep key material out of source control. Use envelope encryption for cloud KMS.
- **V7 Error Handling & Logging**: Return generic errors to clients, log structured events with trace IDs, and scrub secrets/PII. Route security logs to immutable storage.
- **V8 Data Protection**: Require TLS 1.2+ with modern ciphers, enforce HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP), and redact sensitive fields before logging.
- **V9 Communication**: Guard SSRF, DNS rebinding, and outbound calls with allowlists and timeouts. Use parameterized requests for SQL/NoSQL access.
- **V10 Malicious Code**: Pin dependencies, scan for known vulnerabilities, and review supply-chain updates before rollout.
